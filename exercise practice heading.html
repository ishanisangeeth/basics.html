      <h1>the fox and the grapes</h1>
     <p>on a hot summer day,a fox wandered across the jungle in order to get some food.
       he was very hungary and desperatly in search of food.soon he reached a vineyard which was laden with juicy grapes.
       he decided to steal some grapes.he jumped high and high,but he couldn't reach the grapes. the grapes were too high but he refused to give up.
       he tried many times,but couldn't reach.it was getting dark and the fox was getting angry.his legs hurt,so he gave up in the end.
       walking away,he said,''i'm sure the grapes were sour anyway.''
